                <p>When we think of intelligence, usually IQ comes to mind. IQ stands for intelligence quotient, which refers to a score on an IQ test. Modern IQ tests seek to measure intelligence through scoring people on tasks designed to represent a range of mental abilities such as different types of reasoning, general memory and learning, spatial ability.</p>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is our ability to understand and regulate emotions effectively. It’s about how well we understand and manage our own emotions, how well we perceive and understand the emotions of others, and also how we use that information in our thinking and decision making. For example, in managing our own emotions we can recognise when we are becoming angry and calm down before reacting.</p>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is hugely important as it influences so many aspects of our daily lives. It informs how we relate to those around us, how we conduct ourselves, how we build and manage relationships and so much more. Having strong emotional intelligence helps us lead better lives both professionally and personally. It’s associated with excellent leadership, conflict resolution, and reduced stress and many other advantageous things.</p>
