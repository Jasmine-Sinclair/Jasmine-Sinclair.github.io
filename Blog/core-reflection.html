              <p>
                Unlike linguistic languages, nobody grows up knowing programming languages. Pretty much everyone has had to start from the same point of not knowing anything. We have all had to learn, and that process is ongoing. I think that’s really important to keep in mind both for ourselves and for others. Everyone has something they can teach us, and vice versa. Be patient with others and help out if you can,  you were once in the same position. Likewise, remember that there are others who were once in your shoes, and if they can learn then so can you.

              <h3 class="blog-post-content-subheading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                Just how useful the reflections can be! Often when I was writing them I found myself realising things, or things would click into place. They ended up being pretty helpful for my learning. Especially with reflecting on the things I felt frustrated by at the time. Having insight about what didn’t go well helps me to learn from my mistakes so I can (theoretically) avoid repeating the same ones over and over.

              <h3 class="blog-post-content-subheading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                Sometimes the core stuff would bring things up about myself that I don't like, so being confronted with those was a bit difficult. Another aspect was taking what I’ve read/learned and actually putting those things into practice. It's all a work in progress, you just have to keep at it.

              <h3 class="blog-post-content-subheading">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>
                Knowing how to program and knowing how to work like a programmer are different things!
                <br><br>
                The technical stuff really is only half the battle of programming. There’s a lot of other stuff that’s important for success as a programmer. For example, issues in programming are inevitable, so being able to deal with them is essential. This goes beyond just the problem solving aspect, you need to be able to deal with things mentally and build resilience.
                <br><br>
                There's a lot of other stuff too that’s important for actually working as a programmer in a workplace, like communication and whatnot.
              </p>
              <h3 class="blog-post-content-subheading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
              <p>
                I can see the merit in all of it, even if there were a few things I did not personally find useful. Some of the stuff I already knew, but it was nice to have a reminder and to have them reinforced. For me what did feel like a waste of time though was writing stuff out when I knew I already understood something and could explain it to someone or when I felt like I wasn’t going to get anything out of it. Like the time I spent trying to write a blog post on neuroplasticity even though I have a psychology degree could have definitely been better spent programming for sure.
