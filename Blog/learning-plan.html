            <article class="blog-content-container">
                <p>I’m keeping an open mind though about employment following this course. I haven’t worked out too many details just yet, like if I have a preference between front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, or a preference between startups and big businesses. By the end of this course I will have a better feel for those things.</p>
                <p>If I’m not able to find meaningful paid employment in the field following this course then I’ll look into how I can put my skills to good use charitably until I do. That would be an awesome way to keep my skills and knowledge sharp while also helping to give back.</p>
                <p>When it comes to learning, I have a lot working in my favour. Responsibility is a big one. To me this means taking ownership of my actions. Knowing that I am in charge of deciding what I do and say, and that I am accountable for outcomes resulting from my choices. This goes along with my resilience. Being resilient means that I don’t let setbacks keep me from choosing to do things which seem difficult or hard. It allows me to continue to try instead of giving up.</p>
                <p>I can also hit snags though, like with things like perfectionism. I can find myself getting bogged down with trying to make things meet my standards, and/or I’m often not content with my work. </p>
                <p>In terms of human skills, I could use some development in the team-work and communication department. Sometimes I feel reluctant to contribute to discussions due to a lack of confidence, usually in my knowledge or abilities.</p>
                <p>So how will I manage my workload? At the moment I don’t have any ongoing commitments I need to account for. I’m incredibly fortunate that I am able to make this programme a priority in my life. I know that bootcamp is a big commitment, so I have that time blocked off in my calendar.</p>
                <p>For foundations, I think a good place to start is at the beginning of each sprint to take a look at all the content for that week and list it in a single document. Being able to see everything on one page will be helpful for me to assess what my workload is that week, and to see how I’m progressing through it. I’ll create a rough timeline for what I would like to have done by when. I’ll be mindful to think about anything I might have going on that week and the potential impacts that may have and plan accordingly. </p>
                <p>From that document I can look at what I need to do and break things down to create daily goals for myself. That way I can have a focus and clear direction for work each day. I’ll also ask myself what challenges I might run into. At the end of each day I will review my goals and consider what went well, and also what didn’t.</p>
                <p>Having a clear understanding about what is expected of me is important for working productively with others. It means I am able to factor in my obligations to others when I am planning and managing my workload to ensure I meet them. I really hate letting others down! I will seek clarification of my obligations if I need to, and I will communicate any concerns as soon as possible. The earlier something is brought up the easier it will be to deal with.</p>
                <p>Usually I try to solve my problems on my own in the first instance, but if my usual methods aren’t getting me anywhere then I’ll need to ask for help or I’m just wasting my time. Asking for support from my peers over slack is a great way to get help.</p>
                <p>Maybe there’s something my fellow learners aren’t able to help with, for example if I’m worried about a deadline. In that case I will reach out to my facilitator for assistance. Bringing things up as early as possible gives the best chance of being able to work them out before they turn into a bigger issue.</p>
                <p>If (or rather when) things are building up and beginning to stress me out, I’ll need a plan for how I’m going to get myself out of there. Usually having a plan and knowing what I need to do helps me feel less stressed. I’ll start by taking stock of what needs doing, then formulate a plan for tackling them. I’ll consider things like priority (deadlines/impacts on other students), the pareto principle (80/20 rule), and will break things down further if needed. From there I’ll work out a timeline and schedule for what needs doing and when. Meanwhile I’ll take care of my wellbeing through things like practising mindfulness and self care.</p>
